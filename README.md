# Retail Price Optimization

### Project Overview:

Retail Price Optimization is the process of determining the optimal price points for products to maximize profits while maintaining competitive pricing and customer satisfaction. This project applies various machine learning algorithms to predict the total retail price based on features such as competitor prices, ratings, and other product attributes.

### Objective:

- Predict Total Retail Price: Use machine learning models to predict the total retail price of products.
- Compare Algorithms: Evaluate and compare the performance of different regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge Regression, RandomForest Regression, and Bagging techniques.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning methods such as GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

### Data Preprocessing:

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for modeling.
Handled missing values and outliers.
- Performed feature scaling and encoding as needed.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyzed the distribution of key variables.
Explored correlations and relationships between features.

### Modeling:

- Applied the following machine learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression: A basic regression model to establish a baseline.
- Lasso Regression: Applied L1 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Ridge Regression: Applied L2 regularization for better model performance.
- RandomForest Regression: An ensemble method capturing complex relationships.
- Bagging Techniques: Enhanced performance using ensemble methods.
### Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Employed GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for systematic optimization.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy.
Compared results across different models and tuning methods.
